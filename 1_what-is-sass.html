        Sass = Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets

        Sass is a preprocessor / precompiler

        It enhances the functionailty of css

        files use both .scss and .sass file extensions. .scss is preferred

        A .sass file works on indents and doesn't use curly braces like regular css. Instead it uses indents like in HTML

        a .scss file uses curly braces and is easier to read.

        The browser doesn't read sass files. it has to be compiled down to regular css

        NPM = Node Package Manager

        How Node Sass Works 
        1. download sass package through node

        2. Create an NPM script that watches your sass folder

        3. The NPM script will then compile all the sass you write into regular css and put it into another folder.

        Sass allows you to use - 

        Variables
        Nesting
        Partials / imports
        functions & Mixins
        Conditionals
        Inheritance
        Operatos & Calculations
        Color Functions

        It turns css into more of a dynamic programming language
