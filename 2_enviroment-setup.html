<!-- Setting Up Node Sass Step By Step -->

<!-- 
    1. Go to node js .org and download the lts version onto your machine.

    2. Open your terminal in mac or vs code.

    3. Type npm -- version to make sure it's installed.

    4. Create a package.json file by typing npm init -y into the terminal (the -y skips the whole answering questions part)

    5. Clean up the terminal at anytime using control L

    6. Install sass by typing npm install node-sass. It will create a folder called node modules and be listes as a dependancy in package.json

    7. in package.json change "test" to "sass" under "scripts"

    8. In the "" next to sass, delete what's in them and paste this "node-sass -w scss/ -o dist/css/ --recursive"
    
    9. create a folder named scss and put a file in it called main.scss, You should have a sass logo on the folder and the file.

    10. Create a folder called dist

    11. in the terminal, type npm run sass. This will have your script convert all of your sass into regular css and put it in the dist folder.

    12. create an index.html file in the dist folder to write your code and get updates.

    13. link your new index.html to your main.css file (./main.css)
