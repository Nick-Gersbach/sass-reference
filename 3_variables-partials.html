    <!-- Notes -->
    <!-- 
        Sass variable syntax - $property: value;
        
        Real life example
        $color: blue;

        body {
            background: $color;
        }

        It is up to you when, how, or if you even want to use variables. If you do use them then it's best to use them for values that you are going to use over and over AKA 
        
        You can store all of your variables in another file in your scss folder. This is also called a partial. When you name a partial folder you must start the name off with an underscroe (_variables) so the computer knows that it doesn't need to compile them. We don't need a variables .css folder.

        partials aren't necessary, they are just used to organize your code a little better.

        If you make a partials folder you'll need to cut and paste your code into it and then import the file in your main.scss stylesheet. @import 'variables'; never put the underscore when importing.
